# Bullet journals are not what you think
For the last few years, I've tried a whole bunch of different methods to try and organize my neverending to-do list with no luck, I never felt like I was making any progress. I tried just about everything digitial my app download history is littered with whatever the hottest app was - evernote, clear, todoist, notion, but every time I would try to change up my process and move to something digital, I failed, because I was fighting against decades of writing everything down. Something I've continued to do is to write things down! I generally take notes in most meetings by hand, I have always had to do lists written down, and the friction of transferring things to something digital just never clicked for me. I also tried various kinds of pre-formatted planners, meeting notes notebooks with separate to-do list notebooks, I have stacks and stacks of notebooks full of my illegible handwriting. 

So, about a month ago at this point, I re-discovered the bullet journal. Now, if you are like me, then you've got a misconception about the bullet journal method. You've googled it and the results are overflowing with "BuJo" - gorgeously designed instagrammable spreads with perfect penmanship, fancy notebooks adorned with washi tape, habit trackers, study guides, inspirational quotes, shopping lists, "how to acheive your goals!" etc. when all you want to do is learn a system to help wrangle the chaos in your life & work. Well, you don't have to do those things! Ryder Carrol's original system is simple. to be successful, I focused on that, but it was surprisingly hard to find real-world stories from folks who use the bullet journal, particularly to help wrangle their job as a software engineer. So, hopefully this is the post that I was looking for for someone else. And you don't need fancy supplies or artistic talent, I promise! 

The beauty of the bullet journal system is that it's completely flexible. Because you start with a blank page and then add your own dates and lines to it, there is no guilt that you missed a page or that you didn't fill out the calendar for that day or that the kinds of notes you want to take don't fit into the structure of the page in front of you. But, there's _just enough_ structure to it that you aren't endlessly circling without moving forward. You can start at any time, no worries about buying a planner for the year and leaving multiple months blank (the very thought of that gives me anxiety!).

Also, I decided to combine all of my life into a single book. Some folks might have separate places for work and life, but I really needed one notebook to rule them all.

# How to get started
Step 0 is to have an attitude of just going for it without judgement. You don't have to be perfect, you can cross things out, cut out pages that don't work, try something new, throw away the things that don't work, and add things that do work for you! It's beauty is it's flexibility. As you will see, my usage changed over time for the first month, and it will continue to change as I use it longer-term. I'd also recommend that you visit bulletjournal.com - the official home of the creator behind the system, and watch the getting started videos there. I'll re-iterate some of the steps below, but with a focus on how I use them.

## Set up your notebook
I sat down in front of the TV one evening and cross-referenced the main site and one or two other "getting started" posts. It took me about an hour (most of which was spent filling in dates on the future log), but you can do it in a much shorter time if you want to get going quickly.

1. **Grab a notebook, any blank notebook will do!** 
It's helpful if your notebook is small enough to be carried around easily - A5 (approx 5" x 8.5") is a good balance of space to write and carryability. Dotted or grid pages are helpful for drawing straight lines, and pre-numbered pages will cut out a step, but neither are a requirement. Same with bookmarks, if it has 1 or more built-in ribbon bookmarks, great. If not, you can improvise.

I dove into my trove of conference swag notebooks and used this one from Smashing Conference. It had pre-numbered, dotted pages, and a single bookmark. As you can see from the photos, I made a few simple modifications over the course of the month - I superglued a second ribbon inside the back cover, and I used some wide elastic leftover from a tutu-making project to add a pen holder loop. 

2. **Grab a writing implement and number the pages of your notebook**
I lucked out and had a pre-numbered notebook, if you don't have one, don't let that friction stop you! For writing implements, you don't need fancy pens, whatever you have at hand or even a pencil are perfectly fine! I like the feel of pen, so I grabbed one of my trusty blue pilot G-2 and dove in. At some point I misplaced my blue pen and switched to black. No big deal! 

3. **Add a Key of symbols to the first page as a reference**
This is something I found online as an extension of the core system and I've found it super helpful. As you can see from all the scribbles and crossing out, the symbols I've used have changed over time. But I use the classic "Rapid Logging" symbols from the original system, and I'd def suggest that you visit the main site to learn more about those. I've added a few of my own, feel free to use them or create your own based on your needs.

(dot) = task
(dash) = note
(circle) = event
(x) = completed task
(gt) = migrated
(lt) = scheduled
(strikethrough) = irrelevant
(caret down) = delegated
(clock) = due date

signifiers:
(asterik) = important
(question) = needs decision
(lighbulb) = idea

I also used this page to note the number of rows and columns in the grid to help me layout pages evenly! 

3. **Add an Index page**
Leave this blank for now, we'll come back to it in a second. But the index is the key to the whole system - it's how you find the pages that you want to refer back to, and the beauty is you can add anything you want to the index, it's all up to you.

4. **Add a Future Log for the next 12 months**
Skip a page or two to leave space for your index to grow. The future log is a simplified calendar view of the next year. Start with next month (I didn't realize that and added the current month but didn't really need it). Because I am a perfectionist, I counted the number of rows and divided that by three to have three months per page for a total of 4 pages. Flip back to your Index and add an entry for your Future log and note the pages. 

The future log is the place to add events and commitments that are happening/need to happen in a specific month. I have my digital calendar where I keep track of day to day work meetings and personal life appointments, so I don't use the future log for *everything*, mostly just the most important stuff I need to remember to do like deadlines, upcoming conference talks, vacations, etc. I've been layering on pieces of the GTD system to my bullet journal practice, and I really like the approach of only putting things in the month that I absolutely have to commit to. I also added in holidays and birthdays, which in some months takes up a lot of space, so I might try a different layout for my next journal's future log. Tracking down birthdays and holidays also took me the longest, so you can skip it and/or come back to it to cut down on time.

5. **Add a Monthly Log for this month**
Remember how we skipped this month in the future log? Well, that's because we are going to add in a calendar for this current month with a ton more detail as it's own page. If it's the middle or end of the month, that's okay! I filled out the entire month (and as you can see I messed up the days) and then backfilled some important events from the previous weeks. I also used the OG system layout for this page, with one row per day, and then in the empty space below I added the most important tasks to finish for the month, but TBH I have tried this in two months now and it's not working for me, I lose track of these tasks because I'm focused on the calendar above above, so next month I will likely leave that off. Add this month as an entry in your index!

6. **Add a Monthly Tasks page for this month**
I originally had two pages, one for work and one for home, but that was almost too much room, I ended up adding a lot of ideas and tasks that I didn't get to which was a bit disheartening when I went to write out the task list for the next month (not that almost every bullet is marked with a forward arrow for Migrated aka moved to next month). So, the second month, I added some more GTD thinking to my approach and slimmed this down to a single page split in half between work and home, and I'm trying to only add things to this list if they are a priority or I absolutely _need_ to get these things done this month. You might even want to skip filling this out for now and move to the next step, then come back to this! Add this page to your Index - learn from my error and indent everything under the month so you can more quickly scan things by month. 

7. **Start a Brain Dump page** (note this isn't "classic" bullet journal but something I added, so you can totally skip this step or come back to it)
When I first started to fill out my Journal I was also in the middle of reading GTD and decided to start with the practice of getting everything that was in my head out and onto the page so that I could "close the open loops" in my brain. To that end, I filled out this page with all of the random things that were swirling around in my head in a stream of conciousness without worrying about home vs. work or long vs. short term or big vs. small tasks, I just threw everything on the page. This was really helpful for filling out that initial Monthly task list. And of course, add this page(s) to your index! 

8. **Start your Daily Log**
This is really the core of the whole system and is where you will use those symbols from the key the most. Start each day by writing a date header for today - I usually do it in the format of `AUG 18 - TUES`, and then I've landed on drawing a simple horizontal line with a strip of pink highlighter for visual differentiation. Then, start adding in some notes for today - don't be afraid to add bullets for things that you've already done or meetings you had and cross them out! Don't pre-generate your daily sections, but fill out the day and then when the day is done, you can add the next day on the next line, taking up as much or as little room as you need.  

## Process
Now that your notebook is all set up, let's talk about the process of using this thing you've just created. There are a few things that I've found have been helpful as I've developed my process. 

1. **Daily Logging**
I think at first, getting the hang of the daily log was the biggest challenge for me and went through some fits and starts. The system I've landed on to organize my daily logs is that I list out my important to-dos and appointments for the day at the beginning of that day's section using ALL CAPS so that each fits on one line. Then, I will switch to note-taking mode, where I'm not exactly "rapid logging" everything, but combining bullets and longer-form notes in a looser style and with my bad penmanship in all it's glory. Usually I will nest notes for a meeting or topic under a header, and there have been cases where I've captured enough notes and/or thoughts that I want to be able to refer back to it later, so I added the header as an entry in my index. 

Really the foundation of it all is to write everything down. I mean EVERYTHING. By far the best part of the bullet journal is that it's one notebook to rule them all, no more multiple notebooks and pads and sticky notes scattered around my house and office. Put everything in one place so you can start to trust your journal as your external brain - no worries about oh is this the right place to write this or the right format, just write it down so you don't lose it.

2. **A note on Collections**
Collections are another part of bullet journaling that can feel intimidating, especially if you spend time on instagram & pinterest and see the overwhelming list of ideas out there. I've found it helpful to think of a collection as just a page full of stuff that you want to reference back to. So, it can be something specific like a brain dump, or a project plan, or a list of books you want to read, or something organic like notes from a meeting that you want to save or the notes that formed the basis of this blog post were a collection! 

3. **Migration**
Either first thing in the morning or in the evening as I'm winding down my work day, I will go back and look through my log from the day (or previous day if it's the next morning) and cross off any bullets that I completed, then move anything that I didn't complete (and stil think is a priority) to the following day. Technically you are supposed to put a little migrated arrow to show that you moved it to the next day, but I'm not always great at that! 

If there is something that I need to de-priorize I will move it into the monthly task list. I'll also take a look at my monthly log to see if there are any upcoming deadlines or important meetings that I need to start working on or preparing for. I'll also scan the monthly task list to see if there are any other tasks to pull into my day.
